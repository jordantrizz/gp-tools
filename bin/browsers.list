# List of browsers and their categories
# e.g., WORD delimited by tab(s) TYPE
# TYPE can be any type and it's not limited to the ones below.
#
# **IMPORTANT NOTE**:
# ---------------------
# The SIZE of the list is proportional to the run time.
# Thus, the longer the list, the more time GoAccess will take to parse it.
#
# Also, you should note that the higher the browser/item is on the list, the
# faster the parsing will be.
#
# The list needs to be specified using --browsers-file=<path>. This file is not
# parsed by default.
#
# The items below are sample crawlers, adjust as needed.
#
# Categories: Crawlers, Feeds,Uptime, Others, Firefox, Opera, Edge, MSIE, Game Systems, Surf, Chrome, Podcasts
#
# The user agent name and the category have to be separated by tabs not spaces
